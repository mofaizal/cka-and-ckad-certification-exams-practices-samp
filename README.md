# CKA or CKAD certification exams practices sample

Are you preparation for  CKA or CKAD certification exams, here is some of the practices sample that you can practices. Please note that these question not similar to actual exams. This will help you to familiarize yourself as you will be required to demonstrate knowledge of each topic in order to pass the exam.

### Practices Question #1 

### Context 

Create application deployment called car-mart using kubeclt 

### Taks 
-	All objects should be in the ``` cars ``` namespace. This namespace already exists in the cluster.
-	The deployment should be named ``` car-mart-webapp. ``` 
-	The deployment should have ``` 3 replicas. ``` 
-	The deployment's pods should have one container using the ``` nginx ```  image with the tag ``` 1.19 ```

```bash
kubectl create deployment --namespace cars car-mart-webapp --image=nginx:1.19 --replicas=3
```
</details>


### Practices Question #2

### Context 

You are running an application called ``` car-mart ``` app in Kubernetes. You have deployed the app as ``` car-mart-webapp ``` in ``` cars ``` namespace. The deployment of ``` car-mart ``` app done via kubectl. You donâ€™t have backup so you boss ask you to persist the configuration. You need to export the ``` car-mart ```  app deployment and associated configuration in ``` yaml ``` file. 

### Taks
-	Export car-mart configuration to yaml file

<details><summary>show me the solution </summary>

```bash
kubectl get deployment -n cars car-mart-webapp -o yaml > car-mart-webapp.yaml
```
</details>


### Practices Question #3

### Context 

You have running application name called ``` super-store ``` in the ``` apps ``` namesspace. You need to explose the deployment to exteranl communication. 


### Taks
-	Expose a service for ``` super-store ``` deployment and allow external traffic communicate to web server. 
-	Expose the port to ``` 8080 ``` and name the servic to ``` super-store-service ```

<details><summary>show me the solution </summary>

```bash
kubectl -n apps expose deployment super-store --port=8080 --target-port=80 --name=super-store-service
```
To validate the connectivity is working. you need to connect to the service. if you are going across namespaces, you should use <service-name>.<service-namespace>:<service-port> as the service address. within namespace you dont required to specifiy the service namespace. 

```bash
kubectl run busybox-temp --image=busybox -it --rm --restart=Never -- wget -qO- -T 3 http://super-store-service.apps:8080

OR 

kubectl run busybox-temp -n apps --image=busybox -it --rm --restart=Never -- wget -qO- -T 3 http://super-store-service:8080

```

### Practices Question #4

### Context 

Create application deployment called cloud-store using kubeclt 

### Taks 
-	All objects should be in the ``` cloud ``` namespace. This namespace already exists in the cluster.
-	The pod should be named ``` cloud-store ```  
-	The deployment's pods should have one container using the ``` nginx```  image with the tag ``` 1.21 ``` 

<details><summary> show me the solution</summary>

```bash
kubectl run -n cloud cloud-store --image=nginx:1.21
```
</details>


### Practices Question #5

### Context 

You need to decouple configuration artifacts from image content to keep containerized applications portable. 
Create ConfigMaps and configure Pods using data stored in ConfigMaps.

### Taks 
-	Create a ConfigMap called ``` my-config ``` from existing file name ``` my-configmap.txt ```
-	Create a pod named ``` my-pod ```  uses the environment variables from the ConfigMap.
-	Use container image  ``` nginx```  with the tag ``` 1.21 ``` 
-   Shell into the Pod ``` my-pod ``` and validate the env by printing out the created environment variables.
-   Inside the pod store the output txt file called ``` configmap-value.txt ``` 

<details><summary> show me the solution</summary>

Create ConfigMap using existing file 
```bash
kubectl create configmap my-config --from-env-file=my-configmap.txt
```
Creat a pod using dry-run and output as a yaml to edit 
```bash
kubectl run my-pod --image=nginx:1.21 --restart=Never -o yaml --dry-run > my-config-pod.yaml
```
use vi editor to edit the file 
```bash
vi my-config-pod.yaml
```
orginal file will look like below 

```yaml
  1 apiVersion: v1           
  2 kind: Pod
  3 metadata:
  4   creationTimestamp: null
  5   labels:
  6     run: my-pod
  7   name: my-pod
  8 spec:
  9   containers:
 10   - image: nginx:1.21
 11     name: my-pod
 12     resources: {}
 13   dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
 14   restartPolicy: Never
 15 status: {}
```
Edit and add lines 12,13 and 14. The final YAML file should look similar to the following code snippet.

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: null
  labels:
    run: my-pod
  name: my-pod
spec:
  containers:
  - image: nginx:1.21
    name: my-pod
    envFrom:
    - configMapRef:
        name: my-config
    resources: {}
  dnsPolicy: ClusterFirst
  restartPolicy: Never
status: {}
```
Create the Pod using the YAML file.

```bash
kubectl create -f my-config-pod.yaml
```

```bash
kubectl exec my-pod -it -- /bin/sh
env
```
```bash
env > configmap-value.txt
cat configmap-value.txt
exit 
```
